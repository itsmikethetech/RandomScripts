UberSig.php (rename to .png)

This PHP script generates a dynamic PNG image that displays and tracks various statistics and information about the user and the website. The script connects to a MySQL database to retrieve data, performs several calculations, and displays the results on an image background. 
The generated image includes information such as the user's IP address, browser, operating system, random sayings, and website statistics. This example connects to a legact forum database for information, but it can be adapted to any database.

Prerequisites

    PHP 5.x or higher
    MySQL database
    GD Library for PHP

Installation

    Ensure you have PHP and MySQL installed on your server.
    Ensure you adjust the .htaccess within the folder to switch PNGs to PHPs using the script below:

RewriteEngine On
RewriteRule ^script/(\w+)\.png$ script/image.php?name=$1 [L]

    Make sure the GD Library is enabled in your PHP configuration (php.ini).
    Update the database connection details in the script:

    php

    $host = "localhost";
    $dbname = "db_name";
    $dbuser = "user";
    $dbpass = "pass";

Usage

    Place the script in your web server's document root or a subdirectory.
    Create a file named views.txt in the file directory with an initial value, e.g., 0.
    Ensure the file directory is writable by the web server.
    Place the background images (sig1.jpg to sig6.jpg) in the images directory.
    Access the script via a web browser. The script will output a PNG image.
